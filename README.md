# Github Status Update (AWS Lambda)
A lambda function that updates my GitHub status with a random quote and emoji.

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to learn how to make a lambda function and I thought it would be fun to have a random quote and emoji show up as my GitHub status. Also I tend to not really use GitHub statuses all that much so why not make it fun?

## How to use
Check out the [docs](docs/development.md) for more information on how to get started.
